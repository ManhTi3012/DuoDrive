# DuoDrive
DuoDrive is a closed-loop brushed motor driver design to offer simple and affordable open-source hardware and software.
It can be used to drive 2
* It support both increment-type and absolute-type encoder.
* CAN and UART data interface.
* Support velocity and position control.

# Hardware
DuoDrive is designed to handle high current within a small footprint
Step file can be found in "3D" folder
* Voltage input: 12-24v, 30V absolute maximum
* Maximum continuous current: 25A
* Dimensions: 49mm x 75mm

# Firmware
The firmware is expected to be stable for now, but further testing still needed for stability-related bugs.
Please open a new issues if you encounter any problem.
